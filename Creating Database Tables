For now, this is a text file to help organize the creation of the 	
tables.

This creates a database file where all the tables would be stored.
sqlite3 fireeye_data.db

This creates the base table, will need to be modified for additional
data when added.

CREATE TABLE base_data_template (
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	temperature REAL,
	humidity REAL,
	moisture_level REAL
);
